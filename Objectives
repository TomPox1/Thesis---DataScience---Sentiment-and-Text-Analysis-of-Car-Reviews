This work is based on 3 main "pillars', 3 different questions which I was aiming to find answers for.
Those qustions were:
- Is it possible, through a textual analysis of reviews, to identify positive and negative characteristics associated with car models?
- Is it possible, starting from comments, to evaluate how much consumer perceptions of a carâ€™s features impact the overall rating?
- By using text mining and sentiment analysis functions, it is possible to understand the causes of the changes in average scores of a model, in term of user rating, over the years.

These 3 questions translated in these 3 main topics.
Identify the main positive and negative characteristics that consumers associate with products of different brands.
Quantify the impact that perceptions of certain attributes have on the overall evaluation of a product.
Trace the characteristics that have influenced product ratings over the years.

In the Script I loaded there are some part of the code that were used to answer these questions.

The Report file will contain the whole thesis translated in EN.
